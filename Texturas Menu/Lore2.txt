I've been watching you- you are not with them. <Ivanel coughs quietly.> I am not long for this world, but there is one thing I would have you do while you are here. The hippogryphs here still fight bitterly to defend their home and their companions in the Moon Guard. They have not accepted that the Guard is no more. Please... send them away. Let them know there is nothing left for them to fight for here. 

The Nightborne are here in force. As if that were not worrying enough, they now bring reinforcements. I have seen them opening large portals to Suramar. Through these portals they have called in their constructs. They are immune to much of my magic and so represent something of a stumbling block to rejoining the others. Find the portals and close as many as you can. That should buy us some time.
