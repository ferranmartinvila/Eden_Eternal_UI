Thanks in large part to your substantial efforts, we have discovered the whereabouts of a powerful piece of our history. It should enable us to survive whatever else the Nightborne have to throw at us, and hopefully more. However, recovering it will require a great deal of our energy and focus. We will bolster the Starweaver's scrying efforts, but the slightest disruption will ruin this delicate spellwork. See that we are not disturbed. Speak to Syrana Starweaver when you are ready to begin. 

Conjurer Thalerian must be stopped. He immediately sought out my father's private study when he arrived and he has not yet emerged. I worry that he may have found a very dangerous item. It is called the Astromancer's Keystone. It is used to manipulate the stronghold's defenses. Such magic was meant to protect the Moon Guard- used for any other purpose and it becomes unspeakably destructive. Retrieve the Keystone. Slay Conjurer Thalerian to get it, if you must.
